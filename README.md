# TCP Proxy Server for PostgreSQL
This project implements a TCP proxy server in C++ using Boost.Asio, providing a simple framework for intercepting and logging SQL queries sent to a PostgreSQL database. The proxy server acts as an intermediary between PostgreSQL clients and the actual database server, allowing you to capture and log SQL queries for analysis.
